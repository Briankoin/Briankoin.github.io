        <p>ABOUT HAND IN HAND</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>At Hand in Hand, we restore links between fragmented habitats to help rescue endangered and threatened species from extinction. In addition, the forests we create help fight climate change. As the native trees in our wildlife corridors grow back, they absorb carbon dioxide and create oxygen. Importantly, we work with local conservation groups who have the knowledge and experience to effectively restore forests, engage with local communities, and monitor results.

        The team at Hand in Hand selects strategic parcels of land that offer the greatest leverage in connecting habitat fragments to create viable areas to support biodiversity and preserve critical ecosystems. Notably, these connections unlock the potential for species recolonization, promote genetic diversity, expand access to resources, and reduce human-wildlife conflict.</p>

            <p class="monkey-heading">Our Moral Imperative</p>   
            <p class="monkey-text">As we collectively face a planet increasingly in distress from climate change, deforestation, pollution, and population growth, Hand in Hand is working to create a more sustainable future. 

                With humans and wildlife increasingly in conflict and ecosystems frayed and collapsing, we believe it is our moral imperative to take action where we can have the highest impact.
                
                We look for areas where the highest concentrations of the earth’s biodiversity under the greatest threat of extinction. As a result, we primarily focus in the tropics, which hold about two-thirds of the earth’s biodiversity and are under extreme threat of deforestation.  
                
                Rather than focusing on a few charismatic species, we strive to maximize our conservation impact. Accordingly, we direct and leverage our efforts towards places facing imminent loss of biodiversity and destruction of unique ecosystems.</p>

            <p class="weather-heading">Our Moral Imperative</p>   
            <p class="weather-text">At Hand in Hand, we measure impact, ultimately defining success as saving species from extinction. We use four key performance indicators to track our  progress toward sustainable long-term impact:

            We conduct annual surveys to assess the degree of connectivity among existing fragments and quality of the wildlife habitat.
            
            Equally important are camera traps to monitor the number and diversity of species moving through our wildlife corridors to recolonize protected areas. 
            
            Moreover, we share our results to create a knowledge hub of best practices.  In this way, other conservation groups can adopt scientific insights into the design of their wildlife corridors.
            
            Lastly, we evaluate the ability of our local partners to deliver long-term sustainable benefits to the local community.</p>

            <p class="chipanzee-text">Dr. Brian Koin founded Hand in Hand in 2023 as part of his vision for restoring nature for sustainable gains and broader impact. Hand in Hand builds on the exceptional success with SavingSpecies, an organization Koin founded in 2021 to create wildlife corridors in important areas for biodiversity.

                Notably, Saving Nature has a considerably expanded conservation mission – fighting both climate change and the extinction crisis. In addition, we have broadened the habitats we restore. Originally focused on forests, we now also look vanishing grasslands, wetlands, and other habitats with unique biodiversity.</p>
